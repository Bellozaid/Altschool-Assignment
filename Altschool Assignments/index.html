        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>
          My name is Bello Muhammad Zaid, from Lafia, Nasarawa State, Nigeria. I
          am a student at Altschoolafrica with student ID-
          <b>ALT/SOE/024/2507</b>, studying software engineering, enrolled in
          the Backend track. I am graduate of Software Engineering from
          Staffordshire University UK. I currently work with the federal

      <section class="Reason">
        <h2>Why i joined Altschool Africa</h2>
        <p>
          The nature of my work has shifted my attention from software
          development to computer networking and network administration. This
          has drastically affected my overall development in my primary field
          i.e software engineering. The programming skills I once possess has
          reducing down to almost zero. I registered for this Course to refresh
          my knowlegde of programming and also to become aquainted with the
          current trend in the software development.
